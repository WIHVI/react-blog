# Lorem Ipsum Blog

A React project I have followed on YouTube. It is my first React project
and I really enjoyed the process of learning on how to use components, props, the useState and useEffect hooks, fetching data with useEffect, how to make a custom hook, the react router, router links, route parameters and much more.

I called it Lorem Ipsum Blog because the data I used comes from a free fake API and it is using a lorem ipsum dummy text. :)
